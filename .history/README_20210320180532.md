## General info

I decided to build app which helps to find streets in my town. Then I added main buldings. This project was one of my first bigger web projects. The biggest issue was to add two streets, far from main map. But I made extra map and simple animation - so when street Szadek and Wygwizdow is clicked, new map shows up.
